    "notebooks locally (i.e. on youu own computer) in Docker and are\n",
    "comfortable with the basics of Python: if you’ve already done Code Camp\n",
    "then this will be a refresher and you’ll have plenty of time to get to\n",
    "grips with Git and GitHub, which often presents significant practical\n",
    "challenges. You *should* find this notebook quite straightforward, but\n",
    "take any challenges as a sign that you need to keep practicing since\n",

    "On the [Week 2 of FSDS\n",

    "you’ll see that there is a ‘preview’ link and a a ‘download’ link in the\n",

    "the notebook where it has been ‘rendered’ as a web page. But to make the\n",

    "file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Click on the `Download` link.\n",
    "2.  The file should download automatically, but *if* you see a page of\n",
    "    raw code, select `File` then `Save Page As...`.\n",
    "3.  Make sure you know where to find the file (e.g. Downloads or\n",
    "    Desktop).\n",
    "4.  Move the file to your GitHub repository folder\n",
    "    (e.g. `~/Documents/CASA/fsds/`)\n",
    "5.  Check to see if your browser has added `.txt` to the file name:\n",
    "    -   If no, then you can move to adding the file.\n",
    "    -   If yes, then you can either fix the name in the Finder/Windows\n",
    "        Explore, or you can do this in the Terminal/PowerShell using\n",
    "        `mv <name_of_practical>.ipynb.txt <name_of_practical>.ipynb`\n",
    "        (you can even do this in JupyterLab’s terminal).\n",
    "6.  Now you can add it to Git and GitHub:\n",
    "    1.  `git add <name_of_practical>.ipynb`\n",
    "    2.  `git commit -m \"Adding Practical 2\"`\n",
    "    3.  `git push`\n",

    "#### 1.2.1 Making the Notebook Available to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep all of your notebooks and other CASA0013 content in Git/GitHub,\n",
    "you need to make sure that JupyterLab can access your local git\n",
    "repository. JupyterLab can *only* do this if the git folder is a *child*\n",
    "of the one where you ran `docker run ...`. So if your git repo is\n",
    "`~/Documents/CASA/fsds/` then you need to make sure that you start\n",

    "> **Wrong Place?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you called `docker run ...` from the wrong place, then you will\n",
    "> need to stop the container. Please see the [section\n",
    "> below](#is-the-container-running-sec-containers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the startup command is something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` shell\n",
    "docker run ... -v \"$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work\" ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-v` (short for *volume*) tells Docker what part of *your* computer\n",
    "(`$(pwd)`) to connect to container (`/home/jovyan/work`). `pwd` is\n",
    "short-hand for ‘print working directory’ and is the location where you\n",
    "ran the Docker startup command! So we’re talking about the location on\n",
    "*your* computer when you access the `work` folder from within\n",
    "Docker/Jupyter Lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   On a Mac it will *often* be your `$HOME` (also known as `~`)\n",
    "    directory (e.g. `/Users/your_username/`) because that’s where new\n",
    "    Terminal windows start by default.\n",
    "-   On a Windows machine it *may* be your `$HOME` directory but we can’t\n",

    "#### 1.2.2 Is the Container Running?\n",

    "Docker will happily keep a container running in the background even if\n",
    "you close every open window. So how do you know if the `sds2024`\n",
    "container is already running? There are two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open the Docker Dashboard/Desktop from the menu and make sure that\n",
    "    you select the `Containers` tab on the left (it may be hidden by a\n",
    "    message from Docker about upcoming conferences). You *should* see\n",
    "    something like this if the container is *running* and *available*:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"attachment:./img/Running_Container.png\"\n",
    "alt=\"Container running\" />\n",
    "<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">Container running</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  From the Terminal/Power Shell you should be able to run:\n",
    "    `docker ps`. This will give you output something like this:\n",

    "<img src=\"attachment:./img/Running_Container_2.png\"\n",
    "alt=\"Container running from Terminal\" />\n",

    "Terminal</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `sds2024` *container* is not running then you’ll need to run the\n",
    "startup command (`docker run...`) covered in the [last practical\n",
    "session](Practical-01-Getting_Started.qmd). If it *is* running but in\n",
    "the wrong place, then you should stop it, use `cd` to navigate to the\n",
    "correct location, and then restart it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.3 Connect to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know the container is running you can connected to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "on [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/work/) and should see\n",
    "something like this:\n",
